# Project1

This is a small project of the programming exercises 3 and 4 of Andrew NG's Machine Learning course.

Models like Multiple logistic classifiers and Neural Networks are implemented in matlab from scratch and these models are used to recognize the handwritten digits from a subset of MNIST's dataset.
